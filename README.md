# NoteBud
NoteBud is a web app developed for managing documents and notes with features such as:
- Doc/Note Storage (Using Convex)
- Note Editing (Using TipTap),
- AI Chating with documents (Using Open AI/ChatGPT)
- AI Vector Searching through Notes/Docs (Using Convex Vector Search/Open AI Ada v2 Text Embeddings)
- Make/join Organizations, allowing to sync documents/notes with the Organization (Using Clerk Organizations)
- All for free

This is a project I made to practise and learn more about Back-End Development and storage/database using Convex, Clerk auth, OpenAI, NextJS, TipTap, 3D Spline modeling, Webhooks, and over all I learnt a lot while making this project.
This is a project I intend to improve more and use my own self

### Possible additional features to add
- Allow Document upload for Docs, PDF, and possibly other file type then just the current txt only

### Known Bugs

- Home page gradient not visible on mobile (Solved! Too much CSS Blur making gradient barely visible)
- Home page animated text and 3D Logo both lag on mobile (Solved! Too much performance intensive CSS Blur on gradient)
- Typing in Create Note Drawer on mobile is quite difficult, not ideal for UX even if the UI looks good
